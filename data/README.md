This project uses HDF5 hypserspectral data from the NEON AOP. The data files are large and so
are not stored this repository, they are meant to be located in the folder sister to this one. 

The data were downloaded from http://npk.io/Glvhmt on July 10th, 2018.

There should be 5 hdf files to start.
